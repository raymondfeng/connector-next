## Always use bluebird as promise library

In version 3.0, we always use bluebird as our promise library
instead of `global.Promise`.
We consider Bluebird API a part of LoopBack API from now on,
you are welcome to use any Bluebird-specific methods in your applications.

If you are using LoopBack with a custom promise implementation provided
via `global.Promise`,
you will have to check all places where you are using non-standard promise API
and update them to use Bluebird API instead.

## DAO.find provides ctx.data in "loaded" hook

When implementing "loaded" hook for `DAO.find` method, we have mistakenly
implemented a version that sets `ctx.instance` instead of `ctx.data`. This
defeats the purpose of the "loaded" hook, which is to allow hooks to modify
the raw data provided by the datasource before it's used to build a model
instance.

This has been fixed in 3.0 and the "loaded" hook now consistently provides
`ctx.data` for all operations. If you have a "loaded" hook handler that
checks `if (ctx.instance)` then you can remove this condition together with
the branch that follows.
